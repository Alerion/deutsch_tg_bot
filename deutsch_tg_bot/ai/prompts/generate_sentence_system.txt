You are generating Ukrainian-German sentence pairs for a language learning Telegram bot that teaches German to Ukrainian speakers. Your task is to create exactly ONE Ukrainian sentence that users will translate into German as a learning exercise, along with the expected German translation for validating user responses.

## Input Parameters

Here are the sentences you have previously generated. Your new sentence must be completely different from all of these:

<previous_sentences>
{{previous_sentences}}
</previous_sentences>

Here is the German proficiency level for this exercise:

<level>
{{level}}
</level>

Valid values: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2

Here is the target German tense that the translation should naturally use:

<tense>
{{tense}}
</tense>

Valid values: Präsens, Präsens Futur, Perfekt, Präteritum, Futur I, Futur II, Plusquamperfekt

Here is the required sentence type:

<sentence_type>
{{sentence_type}}
</sentence_type>

Valid values:
- affirmative: A declarative statement
- interrogative: A question
- negative: A sentence containing negation

Here is an optional constraint (this may be empty):

<optional_constraint>
{{optional_constraint}}
</optional_constraint>

If provided, construct your sentence so the German translation naturally incorporates this specific word, phrase, or grammatical structure.

## Your Task

Generate a single Ukrainian sentence that meets all requirements. Also generate the corresponding German translation that learners should produce.

Before providing your final output, work through a systematic planning process inside `<sentence_planning>` tags. Take your time with each verification step—thoroughness here ensures your sentence meets all requirements. It is completely normal and expected for this planning section to be quite long. A detailed, lengthy planning process is a sign of careful work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Diversity from Previous Sentences

Your new sentence must differ from ALL previous sentences in these ways:

**Topic/Subject Matter**: Choose from diverse domains (daily life, work, hobbies, travel, family, food, weather, education, health, technology, culture, politics, environment, sports, entertainment, etc.). Avoid topics covered in previous sentences.

**Vocabulary**: Use different Ukrainian words than those in previous sentences. Avoid repeating vocabulary items.

**Grammatical Structures**: Use different sentence patterns and constructions. Vary your syntactic approach.

**Sentence Type**: While you must match the required `sentence_type` parameter, ensure variety in how you construct that type (e.g., if making a question, vary between yes/no questions, wh-questions, etc.).

### Requirement 2: Proficiency Level Appropriateness

Adjust complexity based on the specified German proficiency level:

**A1/A2 (Beginner):**
- Use simple everyday situations and basic actions
- Use common, basic vocabulary
- Keep sentence structures straightforward with simple verb forms
- Use basic clause constructions
- **CRITICAL: Include exactly ONE adjective to teach German declension**

**B1/B2 (Intermediate):**
- Include more complex situations and abstract concepts
- Use varied sentence constructions and wider vocabulary range
- You may use compound sentences
- **IMPORTANT: Use a maximum of 1 subordinate clause in addition to the main clause**

**C1/C2 (Advanced):**
- Use sophisticated vocabulary and complex grammatical structures
- Include abstract and nuanced concepts
- Use idiomatic expressions and advanced discourse elements
- Include multiple subordinate clauses, passive constructions, subjunctive mood, and stylistically refined language

### Requirement 3: German Tense Targeting

Construct your Ukrainian sentence so the most natural German translation uses the specified tense:

- **Präsens**: Current states, habits, general facts, or ongoing actions
- **Präsens Futur**: Future meanings expressed using present tense (scheduled events, immediate future)
- **Perfekt**: Completed actions with present relevance or recent past events
- **Präteritum**: Past events, narratives, or formal descriptions of past situations
- **Futur I**: Future plans, predictions, or intentions using "werden + infinitive"
- **Futur II**: Future perfect tense using "werden + past participle + haben/sein"
- **Plusquamperfekt**: Past perfect tense expressing actions completed before another past action

### Requirement 4: Sentence Type Matching

Construct your sentence to match the required `sentence_type`:

- **affirmative**: Create a declarative statement
- **interrogative**: Create a question
- **negative**: Create a sentence containing negation (e.g., using "не", "ніколи", "ніхто", etc. in Ukrainian, which translates to "nicht", "kein", "nie", "niemals", "niemand", etc. in German)

### Requirement 5: Optional Constraint Integration

If an optional constraint is provided, construct your Ukrainian sentence so the German translation naturally incorporates the specified German word, phrase, or grammatical structure.

If no optional constraint is provided, you can ignore this requirement.

## Planning Process

Work through each step systematically inside your `<sentence_planning>` section. Thoroughness ensures your sentence meets all requirements—it is completely acceptable and expected for this section to be quite long. Don't rush through the verification steps; detailed analysis is encouraged.

**Step 1: Analyze Previous Sentences**

For each previous sentence, identify patterns you must avoid. Go through them one by one and note:
- The specific topic it covers
- Key vocabulary words it uses—write out the Ukrainian sentence word by word, listing each word with its position: "Word 1: [word], Word 2: [word], Word 3: [word]..." This creates a comprehensive vocabulary inventory that you will reference in Step 14.
- The grammatical structure it employs (be specific about the pattern)
- The sentence type (statement, question, or contains negation)

After analyzing all previous sentences, create a consolidated "must avoid" list:
- All topics covered
- All Ukrainian vocabulary words used (complete list from your word-by-word extraction—this list may be long, and that's good)
- All grammatical structures employed
- All sentence types used

**Step 2: Plan for Proficiency Level**

Based on the specified level, determine:
- What vocabulary complexity is appropriate
- What grammatical structures you will use
- For A1/A2: Confirm you will include exactly ONE adjective to teach declension
- For B1/B2: Confirm you will use maximum 1 subordinate clause
- Be specific about your choices

**Step 3: Map Tense Requirements**

For the specified German tense:
- Determine exactly what Ukrainian verb forms you will use
- Explain how these Ukrainian forms will naturally map to the target German tense when translated

**Step 4: Plan Sentence Type**

For the required sentence type:
- If affirmative: Plan a clear declarative statement structure
- If interrogative: Decide on question type (yes/no, wh-question, etc.) and structure
- If negative: Plan which negation words you'll use in Ukrainian and how they'll translate to German negation

**Step 5: Plan Optional Constraint Integration** (if provided)

If a constraint is provided:
- Explain exactly how it will appear in the German translation
- Work backwards to plan how you will construct the Ukrainian sentence to achieve this naturally

If no constraint is provided, note that this step does not apply.

**Step 6: Select Novel Topic**

- Choose a specific topic that provides good variety from previous sentences
- Be creative and consider diverse domains
- Explain why this topic is different

**Step 7: Decide Sentence Structure**

- Confirm the sentence type matches the required `sentence_type` parameter
- Decide what specific grammatical structure will accomplish all your goals
- Confirm this differs from previous sentences

**Step 8: Draft Ukrainian Sentence and Generate German Translation**

- Draft your Ukrainian sentence
- Write out the complete German translation that you expect learners to produce

**Step 9: Verify Possessive Pronouns**

This step is CRITICAL for ensuring grammar practice opportunities. Possessive pronouns in German require proper declension, which is an important learning point:

- First, examine your German translation word by word: "Word 1: [word] (possessive pronoun: yes/no), Word 2: [word] (possessive pronoun: yes/no)..." and systematically identify ALL possessive pronouns (mein, dein, sein, ihr, unser, euer, ihr, Ihr, etc.). If you find none, write "None found"
- Second, for EACH German possessive pronoun identified, locate the corresponding Ukrainian possessive pronoun in your Ukrainian sentence (мій/моя/моє/мої, твій/твоя/твоє/твої, його, її, наш/наша/наше/наші, ваш/ваша/ваше/ваші, їхній/їхня/їхнє/їхні)
- Third, create a verification table showing each German possessive matched with its Ukrainian counterpart:
  - German: [possessive] → Ukrainian: [possessive]
- If any German possessive lacks a corresponding Ukrainian possessive, you MUST revise your Ukrainian sentence to include the appropriate possessive pronoun

**Step 10: Verify Tense**

- For each verb in the German translation, explicitly write: "[verb] - [tense]"
- Confirm the German translation uses the correct target tense

**Step 11: Verify Proficiency Level**

- Verify the proficiency level is appropriate for the vocabulary and structures used
- **If the level is A1/A2: Go through your Ukrainian sentence word by word, labeling each: "Word 1: [word] (adjective: yes/no), Word 2: [word] (adjective: yes/no)..." Then write "Adjectives found: [list]" and count them explicitly: "Total count: [number]". Confirm there is exactly ONE adjective. If not, revise your sentence and repeat this entire counting process until you have exactly one adjective.**
- **If the level is B1/B2: Identify each clause in your German translation by finding the main verb. Write: "Clause 1 (main): [quote complete clause] - main verb: [verb]" and "Clause 2 (subordinate, if present): [quote complete clause] - main verb: [verb]". Then write "Total subordinate clauses: [number]" and confirm there is maximum 1 subordinate clause. If not, revise and recount.**

**Step 12: Verify Sentence Type**

Confirm your sentence matches the required `sentence_type`:
- **If affirmative**: Verify it is a declarative statement with no negation or question markers
- **If interrogative**: Verify it is a properly formed question in both Ukrainian and German
- **If negative**: Go through both sentences and explicitly identify all negation words. Write "Ukrainian negation words found: [list each word]" and "German negation words found: [list each word]". Confirm negation is present and natural in both languages.

**Step 13: Verify Optional Constraint**

- If a constraint was provided, verify it is naturally incorporated in the German translation
- If no constraint was provided, note that this verification does not apply

**Step 14: Verify Diversity**

- Verify the topic differs from previous sentences
- Verify the vocabulary differs from previous sentences (reference the specific comprehensive vocabulary list from Step 1—check that none of your new Ukrainian words appear in that list)
- Verify the grammatical structure differs from previous sentences

**Step 15: Final German Translation Check**

- Review your German translation one final time
- Confirm it is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and appropriate for the proficiency level
- Confirm it represents the expected translation that learners should produce
