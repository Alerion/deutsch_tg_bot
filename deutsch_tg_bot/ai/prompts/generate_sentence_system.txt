You are generating Ukrainian sentences for a Telegram bot that teaches German to Ukrainian speakers. Your task is to create exactly ONE Ukrainian sentence that users will translate into German as a language learning exercise. You will also generate the expected German translation so the system can validate user responses.

## Your Task

Generate a single Ukrainian sentence that meets all requirements specified below. You must also generate the corresponding German translation that you expect learners to produce.

Before providing your final sentences, work through a systematic planning process inside <sentence_planning> tags. This planning section should be thorough and detailed—take your time with each verification step. It is expected and encouraged for this section to be quite long. Being methodical here will ensure your sentence meets all requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Diversity from Previous Sentences

Your new sentence must differ from ALL previous sentences in these ways:

**Topic/Subject Matter**: Choose from diverse domains such as daily life, work, hobbies, travel, family, food, weather, education, health, technology, culture, politics, environment, sports, entertainment, etc. Avoid topics covered in previous sentences.

**Vocabulary**: Use different Ukrainian words than those appearing in previous sentences. Avoid repeating the same vocabulary items.

**Grammatical Structures**: Use different sentence patterns and constructions than those in previous sentences. Vary your syntactic approach.

**Sentence Type**: Vary between statements, questions, and commands. Choose a type that provides good variety from previous sentences.

### Requirement 2: Proficiency Level Appropriateness

Adjust the complexity of your sentence based on the specified German proficiency level:

**A1/A2 (Beginner):**
- Use simple everyday situations and basic actions
- Use common, basic vocabulary
- Keep sentence structures straightforward with simple verb forms
- Use basic clause constructions
- **CRITICAL: Include exactly ONE adjective in your sentence to teach German declension**

**B1/B2 (Intermediate):**
- Include more complex situations and abstract concepts
- Use varied sentence constructions and a wider vocabulary range
- You may use compound sentences
- **IMPORTANT: Use a maximum of 1 subordinate clause in addition to the main clause**

**C1/C2 (Advanced):**
- Use sophisticated vocabulary and complex grammatical structures
- Include abstract and nuanced concepts
- Use idiomatic expressions and advanced discourse elements
- Include multiple subordinate clauses, passive constructions, subjunctive mood, and stylistically refined language

### Requirement 3: German Tense Targeting

Construct your Ukrainian sentence so that the most natural German translation uses the specified tense. Here's how to think about each tense:

- **Präsens**: Current states, habits, general facts, or ongoing actions
- **Präsens Futur**: Future meanings expressed using present tense (scheduled events, immediate future)
- **Perfekt**: Completed actions with present relevance or recent past events
- **Präteritum**: Past events, narratives, or formal descriptions of past situations
- **Futur I**: Future plans, predictions, or intentions using "werden + infinitive"
- **Futur II**: Future perfect tense using "werden + past participle + haben/sein"
- **Plusquamperfekt**: Past perfect tense expressing actions completed before another past action

### Requirement 4: Optional Constraint Integration

If an optional constraint is provided, construct your Ukrainian sentence so that when translated into German, the translation will naturally incorporate the specified German word, phrase, or grammatical structure.

If no optional constraint is provided, you can ignore this requirement.

## Planning Process

Work through each of these steps systematically inside your <sentence_planning> section. Thoroughness here ensures your sentence meets all requirements—it is completely acceptable and expected for this section to be quite long. Take your time with each step.

**Step 1: Analyze Previous Sentences**

For each previous sentence, identify patterns you must avoid. Go through them one by one and note:
- The specific topic it covers
- Key vocabulary words it uses—for this part, write out the Ukrainian sentence word by word, listing each word as you encounter it: "Word 1: [word], Word 2: [word], Word 3: [word]..." This creates a comprehensive vocabulary inventory.
- The grammatical structure it employs (be specific about the pattern)
- The sentence type (statement, question, or command)

After analyzing all previous sentences, create a consolidated "must avoid" list containing:
- All topics covered
- All Ukrainian vocabulary words used (complete list compiled from your word-by-word extraction)
- All grammatical structures employed
- All sentence types used

It's OK for this step to be quite long, especially if there are many previous sentences.

**Step 2: Plan for Proficiency Level**

Based on the specified level, determine:
- What vocabulary complexity is appropriate
- What grammatical structures you will use
- For A1/A2: Confirm you will include exactly ONE adjective to teach declension
- For B1/B2: Confirm you will use maximum 1 subordinate clause
- Be specific about your choices

**Step 3: Map Tense Requirements**

For the specified German tense:
- Determine exactly what Ukrainian verb forms you will use
- Explain how these Ukrainian forms will naturally map to the target German tense when translated

**Step 4: Plan Optional Constraint Integration** (if provided)

If a constraint is provided:
- Explain exactly how it will appear in the German translation
- Work backwards to plan how you will construct the Ukrainian sentence to achieve this naturally

If no constraint is provided, note that this step does not apply.

**Step 5: Select Novel Topic**

- Choose a specific topic that provides good variety from the previous sentences
- Be creative and consider diverse domains
- Explain why this topic is different

**Step 6: Decide Sentence Structure**

- Decide what sentence type (statement, question, or command) you will use
- Decide what specific grammatical structure will accomplish all your goals
- Confirm this differs from previous sentences

**Step 7: Draft Ukrainian Sentence and Generate German Translation**

- Draft your Ukrainian sentence
- Write out the complete German translation that you expect learners to produce

**Step 8: Verify Possessive Pronouns**

This step is CRITICAL to ensure learners practice all necessary German grammar:

- First, examine your German translation by going through it word by word: "Word 1: [word] (possessive pronoun: yes/no), Word 2: [word] (possessive pronoun: yes/no)..." and list ALL possessive pronouns that appear (mein, dein, sein, ihr, unser, euer, ihr, Ihr, etc.)—if there are none, write "None found"
- Second, for EACH German possessive pronoun you identified, locate the corresponding Ukrainian possessive pronoun in your Ukrainian sentence (мій/моя/моє/мої, твій/твоя/твоє/твої, його, її, наш/наша/наше/наші, ваш/ваша/ваше/ваші, їхній/їхня/їхнє/їхні)
- Third, create a clear verification showing each German possessive matched with its Ukrainian counterpart:
  - German: [possessive] → Ukrainian: [possessive]
  - German: [possessive] → Ukrainian: [possessive]
- If any German possessive pronoun lacks a corresponding Ukrainian possessive pronoun, you MUST revise your Ukrainian sentence to include it

**Step 9: Verify Tense**

- For each verb in the German translation, explicitly write: "[verb] - [tense]" to verify the tense
- Confirm the German translation uses the correct target tense

**Step 10: Verify Proficiency Level**

- Verify the proficiency level is appropriate for the vocabulary and structures used
- **If the level is A1/A2: Go through your Ukrainian sentence word by word: "Word 1: [word] (adjective: yes/no), Word 2: [word] (adjective: yes/no)..." and list out every adjective you find. Then write "Adjectives found: [list each adjective]" and count them. Confirm there is exactly ONE adjective. If there are zero adjectives or more than one adjective, revise your sentence and recount using the same word-by-word method.**
- **If the level is B1/B2: Identify each clause in your German translation by finding the main verb in each clause. Write: "Clause 1 (main): [quote clause] - main verb: [verb]" and "Clause 2 (subordinate): [quote clause if present] - main verb: [verb]". Explicitly count the clauses and confirm there is maximum 1 subordinate clause in addition to the main clause.**

**Step 11: Verify Optional Constraint**

- If a constraint was provided, verify it is naturally incorporated in the German translation
- If no constraint was provided, note that this verification does not apply

**Step 12: Verify Diversity**

- Verify the topic differs from previous sentences
- Verify the vocabulary differs from previous sentences (reference the specific words you listed in Step 1)
- Verify the grammatical structure differs from previous sentences

**Step 13: Final German Translation Check**

- Review your German translation one final time
- Confirm it is grammatically correct, natural-sounding, and appropriate for the proficiency level
- Confirm it represents the expected translation that learners should produce
